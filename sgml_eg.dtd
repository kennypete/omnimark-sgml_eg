<!ENTITY cent CDATA "¢" -- Unicode UTF-8 cent sign: c2 a2 -->
<!--This, above, is the Unicode UTF-8 representation of the
     character, noting that this DTD itself is ff unix and
     fenc utf-8. Therefore, when &cent; is encountered in
     the input stream it is output as "¢".  The SGML (HTML4)
     https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/entities.html
     Character entity references for ISO 8859-1 characters
     produce decimal character references, which is what
     works (though is now less common than hexadecimal)
     for HTML2+, e.g.:
       <!ENTITY cent   CDATA "&#162;"> cent sign, U+00A2 ISOnum

     For HTML5 processing you could include the full named
     character references list, i.e.:
     https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#named-character-references
     as ENTITY declarations, which would look like this:
       <!ENTITY Aacute CDATA "Á">
       <!ENTITY aacute CDATA "á">
       <!ENTITY Abreve CDATA "á">
     ...and so forth.
